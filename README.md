# Modelling and Simulation of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO)

## Paper

[Scientific Reports (Nature Portfolio), 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23159-z)  
Awarded *Best Paper of the Year* by the Austrian Academy of Sciences.

## Overview
Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is an ICU procedure that oxygenates blood externally when pulmonary function is severely impaired. Clinicians had observed a persistent drop in oxygen transfer efficiency during ECMO and suspected **recirculation**—the unintended return of oxygenated blood to the venous system—as the root cause.

I developed a computational model of the ECMO process to test this hypothesis and quantify the contribution of recirculation under realistic physiological and clinical conditions.

## Approach
- Developed a Finite Element model of cardiovascular flow dynamics and oxygen transport  
- Incorporated cannulation geometry, machine characteristics, and patient physiology
- Ran extensive simulations of clinically relevant configurations
- Compared numerical outcomes to ICU observations to improve clinical understanding 

## Key Findings
- **Recirculation is a necessary evil** and not even optimal cannula placement can solve it
- **Intrinsic limitations of ECMO design** impose upper bounds on achievable oxygenation  

## Impact
- Provided clinicians with an explanation for observed oxygenation limits
- Informed interpretation of ECMO performance metrics in ICU practice
- Published in *Scientific Reports* and received **Best Paper of the Year** from the Austrian Academy of Sciences
