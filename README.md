### Overview
Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is an ICU procedure that oxygenates blood externally when pulmonary function is severely impaired. Clinicians had observed a persistent drop in oxygen transfer efficiency during ECMO and suspected **recirculation**—the unintended return of oxygenated blood to the venous system—as the root cause.

I developed a computational model of the ECMO process to test this hypothesis and quantify the contribution of recirculation under realistic physiological and clinical conditions.

### Approach
- Developed a reduced-order model capturing cardiovascular flow dynamics and oxygen transport  
- Incorporated cannulation geometry, ECMO pump characteristics, and patient physiology  
- Ran extensive simulations of clinically relevant configurations  
- Compared numerical outcomes to ICU observations to assess plausibility of proposed mechanisms

### Key Findings
- **Recirculation alone cannot explain the observed efficiency drop**  
- **Intrinsic limitations of ECMO design** impose upper bounds on achievable oxygenation  
- Even optimal cannula placement cannot bypass these physiological constraints  

### Impact
- Provided clinicians with a mechanistic explanation for observed oxygenation limits  
- Informed interpretation of ECMO performance metrics in ICU practice  
- Published in *Scientific Reports* and received **Best Paper of the Year** from the Austrian Academy of Sciences
