# Deploy Marp to GitHub Pages

Presentations to Webpages: Instantly!

## What?

[Marp](https://marp.app/) lets you create HTML slides from markdown (like this!).

This presentation is both a [website](https://alexsci.com/marp-to-pages) and a [README.md](https://github.com/ralexander-phi/marp-to-pages/blob/main/README.md).

## Why?

Treat your presentation the same way you treat code.

- Use git to track changes
- Pull requests to collaborate
- Deploy automatically
- See a problem? Open an issue!
